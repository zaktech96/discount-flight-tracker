  Audit and evolve the brain vault - prune outdated content, discover cross-cutting principles,
  review skills for structural encoding opportunities. Triggers: "meditate", "audit the brain".

# Meditate

**Quality bar:** A note earns its place by being **high-signal** (an agent would reliably get this wrong without it), **high-frequency** (comes up in most sessions or most tasks of a type), or **high-impact** (getting it wrong causes significant damage or wasted work). Everything else is noise. A lean, precise brain outperforms a comprehensive but bloated one.

## Process

### 1. Build snapshots

```bash
sh .agents/skills/meditate/scripts/snapshot.sh brain/ /tmp/brain-snapshot.md
sh .agents/skills/meditate/scripts/snapshot.sh .agents/skills/ /tmp/skills-snapshot.md
```

Files are delimited with `=== path/to/file.md ===` headers. Also locate any agent memory directory if it exists, for example Claude Code's `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`.

### 2. Auditor (blocking - its report feeds step 3)

Spawn a read-only exploration subagent if available. See `references/agents.md` for the full prompt spec. Inputs: brain snapshot, agent memory path if any, and the project agent-instructions file (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or equivalent).

Audits brain notes, agent instructions, and auto-memory for staleness, redundancy, low-value content, verbosity, and orphans. Returns a categorized report.

**Early-exit gate:** If the auditor finds fewer than 3 actionable items, skip step 3 and go directly to step 4.

### 3. Reviewer (after auditor completes)

Spawn one read-only review subagent if available. See `references/agents.md` for the full prompt spec. Inputs: brain snapshot, skills snapshot, auditor report, `brain/principles.md`.

Combines three concerns in a single pass:
- **Synthesis**: Proposes missing wikilinks, flags principle tensions, suggests clarifications.
- **Distillation**: Identifies recurring patterns that reveal unstated principles. New principles must be (1) independent, (2) evidenced by 2+ notes, (3) actionable.
- **Skill review**: Cross-references skills against brain principles. Finds contradictions, missed structural enforcement, redundant instructions.

### 4. Review reports

Present the user with a consolidated summary. See `references/agents.md` for the report format.

### 5. Route skill-specific learnings

Check all reports for findings that belong in skill files, not `brain/`. Update the skill's SKILL.md or references/ directly. Read the skill first to avoid duplication.

### 6. Apply changes

Apply all changes directly. The user reviews the diff.

- **Outdated notes**: Update or delete
- **Redundant notes**: Merge into the stronger note, delete the weaker
- **Low-value notes**: Delete
- **Verbose notes**: Condense in place
- **New connections**: Add `[[wikilinks]]`
- **Tensions**: Reword to clarify boundaries
- **New principles**: Only from the distillation section, only if genuinely independent. Write brain files and update `brain/principles.md`
- **Merge principles**: Look for principles that are subsets or specific applications of each other - merge the narrower into the broader
- **Agent-instruction issues**: Rewrite or delete stale sections in `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or equivalent
- **Stale memories**: Delete or rewrite

### 7. Housekeep

Update `brain/index.md` for any files added or removed.
