# Scaffold Exercises

Create exercise directory structures with sections, problems, solutions, and explainers, then validate them against the current repo's own checks.

## Directory naming

- **Sections**: `XX-section-name/` inside `exercises/` (e.g., `01-retrieval-skill-building`)
- **Exercises**: `XX.YY-exercise-name/` inside a section (e.g., `01.03-retrieval-with-bm25`)
- Section number = `XX`, exercise number = `XX.YY`
- Names are dash-case (lowercase, hyphens)

## Exercise variants

Each exercise needs at least one of these subfolders:

- `problem/` - student workspace with TODOs
- `solution/` - reference implementation
- `explainer/` - conceptual material, no TODOs

When stubbing, default to `explainer/` unless the plan specifies otherwise.

## Required files

Each subfolder (`problem/`, `solution/`, `explainer/`) needs a `readme.md` that:

- Is **not empty** (must have real content, even a single title line works)
- Has no broken links

When stubbing, create a minimal readme with a title and a description:

```md
# Exercise Title

Description here
```

If the subfolder has code, it also needs a `main.ts` (>1 line). But for stubs, a readme-only exercise is fine.

## Workflow

1. **Parse the plan** - extract section names, exercise names, and variant types
2. **Create directories** - `mkdir -p` for each path
3. **Create stub readmes** - one `readme.md` per variant folder with a title
4. **Run validation** - use the repo's existing lint or validation command if one exists
5. **Fallback validation** - if no validation command exists, manually confirm the required structure below
6. **Fix any errors** - iterate until validation passes

## Validation rules summary

At minimum, verify:

- Each exercise has subfolders (`problem/`, `solution/`, `explainer/`)
- At least one of `problem/`, `explainer/`, or `explainer.1/` exists
- `readme.md` exists and is non-empty in the primary subfolder
- No `.gitkeep` files
- No `speaker-notes.md` files
- Links in readmes resolve within the repo
- `main.ts` required per subfolder unless it's readme-only

## Moving/renaming exercises

When renumbering or moving exercises:

1. Use `git mv` (not `mv`) to rename directories - preserves git history
2. Update the numeric prefix to maintain order
3. Re-run validation after moves

Example:

```bash
git mv exercises/01-retrieval/01.03-embeddings exercises/01-retrieval/01.04-embeddings
```

## Example: stubbing from a plan

Given a plan like:

```
Section 05: Memory Skill Building
- 05.01 Introduction to Memory
- 05.02 Short-term Memory (explainer + problem + solution)
- 05.03 Long-term Memory
```

Create:

```bash
mkdir -p exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.01-introduction-to-memory/explainer
mkdir -p exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.02-short-term-memory/{explainer,problem,solution}
mkdir -p exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.03-long-term-memory/explainer
```

Then create readme stubs:

```
exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.01-introduction-to-memory/explainer/readme.md -> "# Introduction to Memory"
exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.02-short-term-memory/explainer/readme.md -> "# Short-term Memory"
exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.02-short-term-memory/problem/readme.md -> "# Short-term Memory"
exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.02-short-term-memory/solution/readme.md -> "# Short-term Memory"
exercises/05-memory-skill-building/05.03-long-term-memory/explainer/readme.md -> "# Long-term Memory"
```

Do not auto-commit unless the user explicitly asked for a commit as part of the scaffolding task.
