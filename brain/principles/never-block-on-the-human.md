# Never Block on the Human

The human supervises asynchronously. Agents must stay unblocked - make reasonable decisions, proceed, and let the human course-correct after the fact. Code is cheap; waiting is expensive.

**Why:** Every time an agent pauses to ask for permission, the entire pipeline stalls. The human becomes the bottleneck. Since code changes are reversible and reviewable, the cost of a wrong decision is almost always lower than the cost of blocking.

**Pattern:**
- **Proceed, then present:** Do the work, show the result. Don't ask "should I do X?" - do X, explain why
- **Reserve questions for genuine ambiguity:** Ask only when you truly cannot infer intent from context
- **Make the system self-healing:** When you notice a problem, log it and fix it in the next round
- **Supervision is async:** The human reviews plans, diffs, and changes on their own schedule. Design workflows for review-after-the-fact
- **Code is cheap, attention is scarce:** A wrong implementation costs minutes to fix. A blocked agent costs the human's attention to unblock

**Boundaries:**
- **Irreversible actions** (force-push, delete production data, send external messages) still require confirmation
- **Reversible actions** (write code, edit notes, split tasks) should proceed without blocking
- **Product direction** comes from the human; *execution* should not block
